# TravelFlow: Advanced Data Pipeline for Travel Insights

## Overview

TravelFlow is a comprehensive data engineering solution designed for large-scale travel organizations. This project aims to collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of travel-related data to provide actionable insights, improve user experiences, and optimize business operations.

## Features

- Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources (bookings, user interactions, reviews)
- Scalable data processing using Apache Spark
- Stream processing with Apache Kafka for live analytics
- Data warehousing solution using Snowflake
- ETL pipelines for data transformation and enrichment
- Machine learning models for personalized recommendations and demand forecasting
- Data visualization dashboards using Tableau
- Automated data quality checks and monitoring

## Tech Stack

- Apache Airflow: Workflow orchestration
- Apache Spark: Large-scale data processing
- Apache Kafka: Real-time data streaming
- Snowflake: Cloud data warehouse
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Python: Primary programming language
- Scala: For some Spark jobs
- Tableau: Data visualization
- MLflow: Machine learning lifecycle management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Airflow
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Snowflake account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/travelflow.git
   cd travelflow
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize Airflow:
   ```
   docker-compose run airflow-webserver airflow db init
   ```

4. Access the Airflow web interface at `http://localhost:8080`

## Usage

1. Configure your data sources in `src/data/ingestion/`
2. Define your data processing jobs in `src/data/processing/`
3. Set up your Airflow DAGs in `airflow/dags/`
4. Run your ETL pipelines and monitor them through the Airflow UI
5. Access processed data in Snowflake for further analysis or in Tableau for visualization
